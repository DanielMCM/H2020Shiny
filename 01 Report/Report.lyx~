Problem characterization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the beggining of the master, we have talked about the european commision
 program 'Horizon 2020' in several courses (Innovation & Entrepreneurship
 or Big Data for example).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the reason why we wanted to take advantage of this assignment in
 order to to dive a little bit in the different projects, organizations
 and topics that are part of it and know how much money it is used in this
 kind of projects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have approach this assignment by concibing our potential users as citizens
 from the european union looking for information regarding H2020.
 We have tried to answer the potential questions that they could have regarding
 the different projects, budget, organizations and researchers that are
 part of this objective 2020.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Regarding the budget:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Which is the total budget dedicated to this projects?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How is the budget divided between countries?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Has the budget evolve during years or has it maintain constant?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Would be possible to start these research projects without european funding?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Regarding organizations
\series default
:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Which organizations work together in some projects? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Which organizations have more researchers?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Where are these organizations located?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Which are the coordinators of these projects?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Regarding projects:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
How many projects are being develop in each country?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How are the projects distributed along a specific country?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Which are the countries with more projects? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How many projects started in a year in each country? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How many projects started in certain period in each country?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Regarding topics:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Which topics are more recurrent?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Which topics receive more funding?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How topics are related with one another?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
After this first approach to the problem, we tried to look for this information
 in the CORDIS webpage 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "here"
target "https://cordis.europa.eu/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in order to know more about the elements present in our dataset.
 We have realized that a worldmap that shows the organizations part of the
 H2020 is available 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "here"
target "https://cordis.europa.eu/datalab/datalab.php"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and that anyone can look for projects in this 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "link"
target "https://cordis.europa.eu/projects/home_en.html"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have also analyzed the different datasets that we have chosen (explained
 in second point) as detailed in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Input files
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tab, in order to have a first approach, we decided to include this analysis
 in the visualization as in this design:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Float figure
placement H
wide false
sideways false
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename layouts/files.PNG
	scale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After analyzing the information that we have available and compare this
 information with the problems that we want to adress, we have decided to
 do the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Perform a 
\series bold
first approach analysis
\series default
 for each file as detailed in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Input Files
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tab, here it is possible to find some first approach visualization as:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Organizations:
\series default
 Pie charts representing the contribution per country and the roles of the
 organizations in projects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Projects: 
\series default
A barplot representing the european contribution per year and a scatterplot
 representing the logs of the european contribution to each project versus
 the total cost, that represents that almost any project would have been
 possible without eruopean funding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
General:
\series default
 It is possible to find tables with the details of each file.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Newpage pagebreak
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Represent the funding that each country receives
\series default
, since little information is available about this topic in the web at a
 first stage.
 In order to do this we have decided to create a treemap representing the
 number of projects and the funding received per country, including more
 details about wich regions/organizations receive this funding.
 This is the first design we did:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Float figure
placement H
wide false
sideways false
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The map available in the web represents all organizations across the world,
 but we considered more interesting to know 
\series bold
where are located the organizations that are coordinators
\series default
 of some of the projects, in order to know if entities outside europe can
 coordinate and request projects, in order to do that, we decided to elaborate
 a map locating the different coordinators:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Float figure
placement H
wide false
sideways false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename layouts/MAP Layout.PNG
	scale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the map available in the web it is possible to know
\series bold
 wich organization works with another
\series default
, but in some cases it becomes unfeasible to follow the connections (for
 example if you go to madrid you can see around 300 dots in Puerta del Sol).
 This is the reason why we chose to create a Graph, including also researchers,
 in order to make this analysis easier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Float figure
placement H
wide false
sideways false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename layouts/graph.PNG
	scale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, in the web page we have several classifications regarding topics
 (by country, by general topic), but unless you know what you are looking
 for, it is difficult to have a 
\series bold
global overview of the different topics
\series default
, this is why we decided to make a TF-IDF scatterplot, showing the 10 more
 relevant words for each topic visually.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All organizations that appear in cordis-h2020organizations.xlsx are part
 of some project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reports are not mandatory for all projects or most of the projects have
 not sent yet theirs (Or they have not been published).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are organizations with different id and the same description, we suppose
 this is because they belong to different projects and/or they have different
 people in charge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are projects with different id and the same Acronynm/Description,
 again we suppose this is because they have different stages or branches

Map
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to answer the questions regarding the projectâs development along
 different countries, we decided to use an interactive Map as visual representat
ion.
 In the following sections, we are going to describe the decisions made
 for the design and development of this visual representation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Data tasks abstractions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Why?
\series default
 Our main goal is to provide to the users an 
\series bold
easy way to explore and summarize
\series default
 where the projects are being developed along the world in order to incentive
 them to create new hypotheses based on the information displayed.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Our users want to make a locate search because they already know in which
 countries, they are interested in, but they donât know where to get the
 summarized information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Actions: 
\series default
On one hand, the user should be able to identify the number of projects
 coordinated in every country, as well as perform comparations over the
 quantity of projects developed among different countries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the visual representation should show to the user how
 many projects are coordinated in a specific country and how those projects
 are distributed in the different regions in the country.
 The user also can have information about the location and the universities
 involved in the development of the projects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, the user should be able to explore the how many projects started
 in in every country in certain period.
 Finally, we want to provide to the users the possibility of stating new
 hypotheses based on the information discovered in the visual representation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Targets:
\series default
 We want to focus on finding an individual value to be displayed in the
 visual representation, in this case we want to get the number of projects
 developed in each country across a period.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
What?
\series default
 Creation of an interactive map.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
How? 
\series default
We need to work on aggregating the number of projects by area, merging and
 transforming the data sets in order to get the necessary attributes, such
 as the name of the country, the latitude and longitude where the projects
 are developed, to draw the map.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If a user wants to have information about the number of projects developed
 in each country across a period, we will also need to perform some filtering
 over the data set.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsubsection
Interaction and visual encoding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to display how many projects are being developed in a country/region
 in a more effective way, we decided to use an interactive map instead of
 other visual representation because this representation is more intuitive
 and expressive for our users to know and to compare the quantity of projects
 developed in an area, as well as where are located the universities that
 are working on those projects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this way, the users can read easily relate the areas with the universities
 where projects are being developed.

\series bold
Dynamic interaction
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We decided to make an interactive map in order to generate relevant views
 for the user and help him to get the information that he/she requires.
 Additionally, we want to provide the possibility to select one or multiple
 countries to be display, make groups based on the spatial position of the
 marks when zoom is done, and select one point that represents the research
 center where a project started.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Marks and Channels
\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We used two type of marks to represent the number of projects and the location
 of them on them depending on the zoom of the map.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we zoom in over a specific area of the map, we are using the identity
 visual channel based on the spatial position on a common scale.
 In order to display where the projects are specifically located, we considered
 to use points marks as in the following image is represented: 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Float figure
placement H
wide false
sideways false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename layouts/Map1.png
	scale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we zoom out the map, we are using a magnitude channel to represent
 how much projects are being developed in an area.
 In order to specify what the visual encoding should express, we decided
 to use an area encoding representation, in which we use containment marks
 by grouping the individual marks (specific points in the map) into clusters
 using the spatial proximity where the projects are located.
 In other words, containment marks enclosures projects based on the geographical
 area and summarize the number of projects in the same geographical area.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We considered to used 3 colors to represent the quantity of projects grouped
 by their spatial proximity.
 A containment mark colored in orange represents those areas which have
 more projects.
 Yellow represents that in that area there are considerably less projects
 that in the orange areas.
 Finally, green represents an area where there are less than 10 projects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Newpage pagebreak
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can see an example of this approach in the following image: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Float figure
placement H
wide false
sideways false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename layouts/Map2.png
	scale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Algorithmic implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For creating the map, initially we used two datasets: cordisref-countries.xls
 and cordis-h2020projects.xlsx.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Computing geolocation
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
From the projects dataset the API R library 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "ggmap"
target "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/ggmap.pdf"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 has been used to assign a default location to each of the countries present
 in the dataset.
 The problem with this when representing the projects in the map is that
 the amount of information that is provided is limited, as we canât differentiat
e projects from different cities in the same country.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve the problem stated above was solved by using two Google Maps APIs
 and implementing them using Python.
 The first was the Google Places API[1] where we extracted the latitude
 and longitude of the universities where the project was developed.
 However, some universities that werenât found using this API were retrieved
 using the Google Geocode API [2].
 This way a big amount of the universities locations was obtained.
 However, in some cases this location was not correct, as to obtain the
 coordinates a text search was being used.
 To correct mistakes when retrieving the location, an additional check to
 discard the coordinates that were from incorrect countries was implemented.
 This way if we retrieved for a university from Spain coordinates from Italy,
 we discarded them and use the default location computed in the first place.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_inset CommandInset href

target "https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After getting the location where each project is located, we created a new
 dataset in which these attributes are added to the corresponding row.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Drawing the map
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
For creating the map, we used 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "leaflet"
target "https://leafletjs.com/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 which is a JavaScript library which has integration with Shiny.
 In the UI we invoke the leafletOutput, and on the server side you assign
 a renderLeaflet call to the output.
 Additionally, in the server side we provide to Leaflet the dataset with
 the projects to be drawn as well as the location (latitude and longitude)
 of each of projects.
 The information about the location is found in the processed dataset explained
 in the previous session.
\end_layout

Why?
\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Actions: 
\series default
Provide to the user the possibility to compare the quantity of capital invested
 for the development of the projects in each country, as well as helping
 them to identify the relation between the number of projects develop in
 a country and the money invested on those projects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We also want to give to the user the chance to explore how the and the money
 are distributed along the different regions of a specific country.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Targets:
\series default
 Two quantitative attributes at leaf nodes.
 We want to focus on finding an individual value to be displayed in the
 visual representation, in this case our target is to display the number
 of projects of the different geographical areas along the world.
 However, we also want to show to the user how is the money investment distribut
ed along these are.
 Therefore, each rectangle (leaf node) in the treemap it will show the values
 for those two values.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
What?
\series default
 Creation of an interactive treemap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
How?
\series default
 We need to work on aggregating the number of projects by geography.
 The map it will contain different levels of granularity because it is intended
 to represent a hierarchy of three levels, therefore the treemap will be
 able to display the number of projects in different levels.
 First, it will show the countries with more projects and bigger project
 investment.
 If the user wants to know more about the number of projects and the investment
 in a particular country, he/she will be able to surf into a region or a
 City.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Interaction and visual encoding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The map is a good tool to discover where projects are located and to detect
 areas with big amount of projects.
 However, we also wanted to allow the user to easily get an idea of the
 number of projects per geographical area as well as its investment amount.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A treemap was a great fit, as we had a hierarchical structure of countries,
 regions and cities of the projects.
 This way using the area to represent the number of projects we could represent
 all the main countries together and easily grasp how the project are distribute

 And if we zoom in a region the most granular detail per city could be seen.

As in the case of the Map, we are using containment marks order to display
 hierarchical data using nested rectangles.
 At the same time, we are using a rectilinear orientation of our elements.
 We are considering that the size of each node is represented by the number
 of projects in a geographical and the color of the node represent the total
 money invested for the development of those projects.

\begin_layout Standard
For creating the map, initially we used a modified file cordis-h2020projects.xlsx
 with the new attributes about the localization of the projects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the creation of the map idiom, we had to extract the cities, regions
 and coordinates where each project is located.
 That information was useful for the development of the treemap idiom.

Reducing the number of categories
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
One problem with a treemap visualization is that we had a large number of
 categories that contain very few projects, so the area was very small,
 and the text identifiers were overlapping.
 To avoid this, if the number of projects was less than a certain threshold
 then those countries, regions or cities were classified as Other.
 This threshold varied depending on the granularity: 100 for cities,10 for
 regions, and 5 for cities.
 For instance, if a country had less than 100 projects then that country
 appears in the treemap contained in the category Other.
 This solution made the treemap more appealing visually, as well as more
 useful, as labels were not overlapping and rectangles with very small areas
 that couldnât be appreciated were not present in the plot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To generate this plot, a tree structure needs to be computed and used to
 store all the information about countries, regions and cities.

Color dimension
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The number of projects per location and with different levels of granularity
 was something key to identify areas with more projects.
 However, the amount of the investment is also very important as some areas
 might have more projects but with less capital invested.
 As we also wanted to represent this information, we decided to use a color
 gradient from red to yellow to represent the size of this investment, dark
 red representing high investments and pale yellow representing low ones.
 The scale chosen was thousands of millions of euros, as the original values
 had too many zeroes, reducing the readability of the legend.

The first problem that we faced was performance, since the graph has 135K
 edges and 64k nodes, it was not feasible to represent the whole graph at
 once, this is why we decided to let the user decide which node she is intereste
d in and plot the nodes that the original node has connections with.

 The nodes have different sizes depending the number of edges (both going

The color of the edges is green, but those edges that represent a contribution
 considered an outlier (above Q4 plus 1.5 the interquartile range) are represente

In order to develop the graph, first of all, we have created the nodes and
 edges files from the original files:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Nodes: The nodes are conformed by the organizations (by id), the projects
 (also by id) and the researchers (by the concatenation of firstName plus
 lastName).
 The weight of the node is calculated once the edges are calculated by taking
 the number of edges that each node has (both going in and out)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Edges: The edges are retrieved from two sources:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Projects-Organizations in cordis-h2020organizations.xlsx file, from this
 file we also take the budget contribution for the weight of the edge.
 In the case of 0 contribution or the researcher, we apply a value of 1
 (minimum).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Researchers-Projects and Researchers-Organizations in Researchers.rds file

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
As the number of nodes and edges is large, we have decided to generate the
 graph in an interactive way as we have explained in the previous point.

We have decided to calculate the tf-idf based on the tittle of each project,
 we took the description of the project as the text.
 After the calculation we extracted the 10 words with higher tf-idf per
 project and join them to the project topic.
 The we would display a sctatterplot showing the average tf-idf per word
 across the different topics and the number of topics in which the word
 appears.
 this would be associated to a way of find out which topics have a word,
 which will allow the user to find the projects associated to this topic
 in the projects file.
